# BudgetingApp
Used for calculating income and expenses

To change for your own use just change the daily pay rate. You can make changes to the script based on how your pay is measured. I just used pay-per-day because mine wont change.

**Biggest challenges when making the app**
1.Figuring out how to display the expenses in the table 
2.Figuring out how to structure the expenses.I though about making them arrays an using loops to access the values or making them objects with a single property and value that would be an object(ex.{a:{x:y}}). I found both of those ways to be complicated an just stuck with using objects with multiple properties :).
